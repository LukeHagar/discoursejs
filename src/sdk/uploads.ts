     * Generates batches of presigned URLs for multipart parts
     *
     * @remarks
     * Multipart uploads are uploaded in chunks or parts to individual presigned
     * URLs, similar to the one generated by /generate-presigned-put. The part
     * numbers provided must be between 1 and 10000. The total number of parts
     * will depend on the chunk size in bytes that you intend to use to upload
     * each chunk. For example a 12MB file may have 2 5MB chunks and a final
     * 2MB chunk, for part numbers 1, 2, and 3.
     *
     * This endpoint will return a presigned URL for each part number provided,
     * which you can then use to send PUT requests for the binary chunk corresponding
     * to that part. When the part is uploaded, the provider should return an
     * ETag for the part, and this should be stored along with the part number,
     * because this is needed to complete the multipart upload.
